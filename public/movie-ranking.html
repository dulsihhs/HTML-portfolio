<h1>My Ultimate Movie Picks for Endless Rewatch Delight</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Fight club</h3>
<p>Fight club uses fighting as the perfect metaphor for doing painful things that are out of your comfort zone.</p>
<h3>Arrival</h3>
<p>I love the movie, how it was directed, how it was shot, how the story was told, the twist! Amy Adams gave a spectacular performance, as well as Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker. Everything about the movie made me think. It wasn't even that day I loved the movie, it was the following couple of days, after I let it marinade did I realize it was the best movie I've seen in years.</p>
<h3>The Social Network</h3>
<p>This film is an utter masterpiece. It is the best biopick I have ever watched. The film is about Mark Zuckerberg and his friend Eduardo Saverin as they go through Harvard as they build the most successful social media platform ever, Facebook. You find yourself feeling so much emotion for the characters. Just like other amazing films, there is no villain. The characters themselves don't act like villains or are particularly bad. They just do immoral things like screwing over their friends. This film is a great movie about remembering where you started. You can't grow if you don't remember where you started. It is also a film about selfishness and where you can find yourself. You can have billions of dollars but you won't have any friends. It's an amazing film and I highly recommend you just get up and watch it. Definitley a 9 or a 10..</p>
